This codebase puts together tools and experiments to analyze self-supervised speech representations. These analysis techniques can be used to replicate the findings presented in [Layer-Wise analysis of a self-supervised speech representation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04734) and [Comparative layer-wise analysis of self-supervised speech models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03929).

# Usage
Follow the next steps in order to generate property content trends for pretrained models from raw wavforms and alignments. Each step is accompanied by a short explanation. You can also find an abridged and collated version of these steps at [examples/recipe.sh](https://github.com/ankitapasad/layerwise-analysis/blob/main/examples/recipe.sh). You can run the script as `. examples/recipe.sh $path_to_librispeech_data` after performing steps 0, 1, and 2a below. Read the accompanying [README.md](https://github.com/ankitapasad/layerwise-analysis/blob/main/examples/README.md) with the recipe script before you run it.

## 0. Pre-trained checkpoints and related setup
Install the relevant model packages to `packages/` and download the pre-trained models in `ckpt_dir`. The default inference in most model packages does not directly return layerwise outputs. This can that can be easily fixed with minor edits to their model files. The edited files are added to the `modellib_addons/` directory.

**Replace the original files in the model packages with these edited versions before proceeding.**

## 1. Clone the repo and install requirements
```
git clone https://github.com/ankitapasad/layerwise-analysis.git
pip install -r requirements.txt

# for wordsim
git submodule update
git submodule init
```
Note that since this repo is intended to be used for one or more of the models listed above, **please make sure to install these libraries in the same environment that has all the necessary installations and dependencies for the corresponding model(s)**.

## 2. Data preparation
### a. Download dataset 
Currently, all the experiments use [Librispeech](https://www.openslr.org/12), so before proceeding further make sure you have the dataset downloaded. Download and extract all the files into the `$path_to_librispeech_data` directory, such that this directory has a folder for each dataset split.

### b. Data preparation
Follow the next two steps to prepare data files.

```
. scripts/prepare_alignment_files.sh librispeech $path_to_librispeech_data $alignment_data_dir
```
This will download and reformat the phone and word alignment files for Librispeech and save the alignments as dictionary files to `$alignment_data_dir`. These `.pkl` files map each phone/word type to a list of tuples `(utt_id, path_to_wav, start_time, end_time)`. This will take a few minutes. NOTE: In order to process the train splits as well (for _MI-*_ experiments), uncomment the relevant portions in the script.  

```
data_sample=1
model_name=wav2vec_base
. scripts/create_librispeech_data_samples.sh $model_name $data_sample $path_to_librispeech_data $alignment_data_dir
```
This will randomly sample audio utterances and phone and word segment instances from Librispeech. The `data_sample` is an identifier for the data sample set. You can have more than one data_sample sets, generated by passing a different identifier, and repeat all the analysis experiments on each data_sample set to check for robustness (using mean and standard deviation for instance).

The list of sampled utterance ids will be saved to the `data_samples/librispeech` directory.

#### _What is `subset_id`?_
Understanding this is not necessary for CCA experiments since those are performed on the smaller dev splits. The following is relevant when sampling and processing utterances from train splits.

For phone and word segments, the sampled set can be split further into subsets identified with numbers `0, 1, 2, ...`. These ids are referred to as `subset_id` in the next steps. This is done so that each subset can be processed in parallel for feature extraction. The extracted representations for each subset are concatenated into one single representation matrix before evaluating analysis scores.

Currently, each subset is under 10000 seconds. This threshold can be changed by passing the `dur_threshold` argument to the `create_data_samples.py token-level` run. 

## 3. Feature extraction

Example: Extract representations from the pre-trained wav2vec2.0 model for dev-clean split
```
model_name=wav2vec_base
model_type=pretrained
dataset_split=dev-clean
data_sample=1
subset_id=0
```

Set `save_dir_pth` as the directory where the extracted representations will be saved. The script will generate sub-folders within `$save_dir_pth` for each different model and each different type of representation. **Pass the same `$save_dir_pth` variable to all the subsequent scripts.**

Frame-level representations from the 7 convolutional layers 

```
rep_type=local
span=frame
. scripts/extract_rep.sh $model_name $ckpt_dir $data_sample $model_type $rep_type $span $subset_id $dataset_split $save_dir_pth
```

Similarly for extracting representations from transformer layers, **run the above script with following changes to the arguments**: 
- Frame-level representations from the 12 transformer layers: `rep_type=contextualized; span=frame`
- Mean-pooled phone-level representations from the 12 transformer layers:`rep_type=contextualized; span=phone`
- Mean-pooled word-level representations from the 12 transformer layers:`rep_type=contextualized; span=word`

The extracted features will be saved to the `$save_dir_pth/$model_name/librispeech_$dataset_split_sample1` directory

## 4. Extraction of context-independent word embeddings
- Generate samples of words from the train set. Note that there is a `num_instances` variable inside the script, that is the value for number of instances' representations averaged for each word embedding. 
```
. scripts/create_word_samples.sh $model_name $path_to_librispeech_data $alignment_data_dir $save_dir_pth $num_instances
```
This will sample the word instances and divide all words into subsets, such that each subset is smaller than 10000 seconds (for processing speech and parallelization).

- Extract representation, you'll run the following for each `subset_id`. The argument `subfname` denotes the sample directory name that is set [here](https://github.com/ankitapasad/layerwise-analysis/blob/main/scripts/create_word_samples.sh#L22) and for which you wish to extract the embeddings.
```
. scripts/extract_static_word_embed.sh extract $model_name $ckpt_dir $subfname $save_dir_pth $subset_id
```

- Once all the subsets are processed, combine the representations to form an embedding map.
```
. scripts/extract_static_word_embed.sh combine $model_name $ckpt_dir $subfname $save_dir_pth
```

## 5. Evaluate layer-wise property trends
- Download and store GloVe and AGWE embeddings maps as dictionary files.
```
. scripts/save_embeddings.sh $save_dir_pth
```

### 1. Canonical correlation analysis
Example: Canonical correlation analysis between the extracted representations and mel filterbank features for representations extracted at a frame-level
```
exp_name=cca_mel
span=frame
. scripts/get_cca_scores.sh $model_name $data_sample $exp_name $span $save_dir_pth
```

The following CCA experiments are possible:
| $exp_name | $span |
| --------- | ----- |
| cca_mel   | frame |
| cca_intra | frame |
| cca_phone | phone |
| cca_word  | word |
| cca_agwe  | word |
| cca_glove | word |

### 2. Mutual information
Example: Mutual information between $span labels and the extracted phone segments for representations extracted from layer 1. The `iter_num` denotes the iteration number. To account for the randomness introduced by k-means clustering, we run this experiment for each sample set multiple times.
```
iter_num=0
layer_num=1
span=phone # or word
. scripts/get_mi_scores.sh $span $layer_num $iter_num $model_name $data_sample $save_dir_pth
```

### 3. WordSim evaluation 
```
. scripts/get_wordsim_scores.sh $model_name $subfname $save_dir_pth
```

The results from all the above measures will be saved at `logs/librispeech_${model_name}/`
